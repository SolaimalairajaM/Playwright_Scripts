How to use Trace Viewer
Step 1 - Open config file and set  trace: 'on-first-retry'
It means - Collect trace when retrying the failed test for the 1st time only
Step 2 - Save and Run a test to fail 
Step 3 - Check trace.zip file created under test-results folder
Step 4 - View trace - npx playwright show-trace trace.zip

Trace Viewer Options
'on-first-retry'    - Record a trace only when retrying a test for the first time.
'off'               - Do not record a trace.
'on'                - Record a trace for each test. (not recommended as it's performance heavy)
'retain-on-failure' - Record a trace for each test, but remove it from successful test runs

To set trace on from command   npx playwright test --trace on

Different ways to view trace

Set Tracing programmatically

test.only('test demo', async ({ page, context }) =＞ {
 await context.tracing.start({snapshots: true, screenshots: true})
 // test code
 await context.tracing.stop({path: 'test-trace.zip'});
});


==============================================================================
let context
let page
test.beforeAll(async ({ browser }) =＞ {
 context = await browser.newContext()
 await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true })
 page = await context.newPage()
})

test.afterAll(async () =＞ {
 await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'test-trace.zip' });
})
